Challenge:

Right now, each chat message that gets sent from client to the server contains
name of the user that the message is coming from, which then gets displayed
right next to the message itself (i.e. when John types "Hello world!",
everybody else see it as "John: Hello world!" on the screen). This is a bit
redundant: if John sends 100 messages to the same chat server, every single
one of those will also carry the string "John" in it. Your goal is to change
the code so that you wouldn't send user's name more than once after you
connect to a server, and it would still be displayed in the chat view, just
like it is now. Think of it as an optimization aimed at reducing the bandwidth
used by the app.




One possible solution:

- RemoteChatRoom: Whenever you connect to a chat server, send a special
message, which would carry name of the connecting user.
- LocalChatRoom: Associate each connection with it's respective username.
- LocalChatRoom: Whenever a chat message arrives, look up username based
on which connection the message came through and display it in chat.
